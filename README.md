# E01b-Smiles
An exercise exploring variables and loops using Python Arcade.

PLEASE NOTE: For this assignment, I changed all the eye ellipses to be 30 pixels wide in the x direction, and 45 pixel tall in the y direction, because I preferred these to the default settings that were given.

main1.py explores the very basics of drawing in Python Arcade. It shows how ellipses work, and is practice in understanding the positioning of the premade pieces to make a smiley face.

main2.py is practice in making the pieces relative to each other. All of the other pieces in the smiley face are set based off of adjustments made to the inital coordinates that the yellow circle is centered upon.

main3.py shows how you can assign these numbers for the pixel measurements and placements to variables before creating the face, which can be very useful.

main4.py shows how you can loop through numbers so that you can just draw a pattern of faces overlaid on each other, or spaced out apart from each other. If you edit the numbers in line 16 and 18, you can change the starting position, ending position, and frequency of this pattern.

main5.py shows the beginnings of uses for mouse tracking, and goes through explicitly showing what each line of code is doing.
